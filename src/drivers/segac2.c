	Sega System C/C2 Driver
	driver by David Haywood and Aaron Giles
	---------------------------------------
	Version 0.81u7 - 22 Apr 2004

	Latest Changes :
	-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	0.81u7| Various Megaplay Improvements (BR, GreyRouge) (using version number of mame)
	0.73 | More of the Megaplay Bios Tests Pass (BR)
	0.722| Improvements to Megaplay (BR) Added a few more Megatech sets but some are bad (DH)
		 | --2 screens is going to cause problems with partial refresh and get_scanlines for
		 | Megatech
	0.71 | Started adding Support for Megatech, first step is improving the Genesis Emulation
		 | The rendering will also need improving to support mid-frame palette changes
		 | (RGB_DIRECT) maybe use tilemaps if its not too messy, added Genesis sound based on
		 | Mess code
	0.54 | Added Ribbit! support. Recoded some of the VDP to handle vertical windows. Removed
	     | the bitmap cache and added partial updating support.
	0.53 | Set the Protection Read / Write buffers to be cleared at reset in init_machine, this
		 | fixes a problem with columns when you reset it and then attempted to play.
		 |  (only drivers/segac2.c was changed)
	0.52 | Added basic save state support .. not too sure how well it will work (seems to be
		 | ok apart from sound where i guess the sound core needs updating) size of states
		 | could probably be cut down a bit with an init variables from vdp registers function
	0.51 | Added some Puyo Puyo (English Lang) Bootleg set, we don't have an *original* english
		 | set yet however.  Also added a 2nd Bootleg of Tant-R, this one still has protection
		 | inplace, however the apparently board lacks the sample playing hardware.
		 | Removed 'Button3' from Puyo Puyo 2, its unneeded, the Rannyu Button is actually the
		 | player 1 start button, its used for stopping a 2nd player interupting play.
	0.50 | Added some Columns/Puyo Puyo 2 dips from Gerardo. Fixed nasty crash bug for games
		 | not using the UPD7759. Made some minor tweaks to the VDP register accesses. Added
		 | counter/timer description. Attempted to hook up battery RAM.
	0.49 | Fixed clock speeds on sound chips and CPU. Tweaked the highlight color a bit.
	0.48 | Added a kludge to make Stack Columns high score work. Fixed several video-related
		 | differences from c2emu which caused problems in Puyo Puyo.
	0.47 | Fixed Thunder Force hanging problem. No longer calling the UPD7759 on the C-system
		 | games.
	0.46 | Cleaned up the Dip Switches. Added Ichidant and Puyopuy2 Dips.
		 | Todo: Complete Columns and Bloxeedc Dips.
	0.45 | Fixed interrupt timing to match c2emu, which fixes scroll effects in several games.
		 | Swapped sample ROM loading in some bootlegs. Added support for screen disable.
	0.44 | Major cleanup. Figured out general protection mechanism. Added INT 4 and INT 2
		 | support. Added shadow effects. Hooked up sound chips. Fixed palette banking. ASG
	0.43 | Added Support for an English Language version of Ichidant-R (and I didn't even think
		 | it was released outside of Japan, this is a nice Turn-Up) .. I wonder if Tant-R was
		 | also released in English ...
	0.42 | Removed WRITE_WORD which was being used to patch the roms as it is now obsolete,
		 | replaced it with mem16[addy >> 1] = 0xXXXX which is the newer way of doing things.
	0.41 | Mapped more Dipswitches and the odd minor fix.
	0.40 | Updated the Driver so it 'works' with the new memory system introduced in 0.37b8
		 | I'm pretty sure I've not done this right in places (for example writes to VRAM
		 | should probably use data16_t or something.  <request>Help</request> :)
		 | Also Added dipswitches to a few more of the games (Borench & PotoPoto) zzzz.
	0.38 | Started Mapping Dipswitches & Controls on a Per Game basis.  Thunderforce AC now has
		 | this information correct.
	0.37 | Set it to Clear Video Memory in vh_start, this stops the corrupt tile in Puyo Puyo 2
		 | however the game isn't really playable past the first level anyhow due to protection
	0.36 | Mainly a tidy-up release, trying to make the thing more readable :)
		 | also very minor fixes & changes
	0.35 | Added Window Emualtion, Horizontal Screen Splitting only (none of the C2 Games
		 | split the screen Vertically AFAIK so that element of the Genesis Hardware doesn't
		 | need to be emulated here.
		 | Thunderforce AC (bootleg)  tfrceacb is now playable and the test screens in Potopoto
		 | will display correctly.  Don't think I broke anything but knowing me :)
	0.34 | Fixed Some Things I accidentally broke (well forgot to put back) for the
		 | previous version ...
	0.33 | Fixed the Driver to Work in Pure Dos Mode (misunderstanding of the way MAME
		 | allocated (or in this case didn't allocate) the Palette Ram.
		 | Fixed a minor bug which was causing some problems in the scrolling in
		 | potopoto's conveyer belt.
	0.32 | Added Sprite Flipping This improves the GFX in several games, Tant-R (bootleg)
		 | is probably now playable just with bad colours on the status bar due to missing
		 | IRQ 4 Emulation.  Sprite Priority Also fixed .. another Typo
	0.31 | Fixed Several Stupid Typo Type Bugs :p
	-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Sega's C2 was used between 1989 and 1994, the hardware being very similar to that
	used by the Sega MegaDrive/Genesis Home Console Sega produced around the same time.

	Notes:	Eng indicates game is in the English Language, Most Likely a European / US Romset
			Jpn indicates the game plays in Japanese and is therefore likely a Japanes Romset

			Another way to play these games is with Charles Macdonald's C2Emu, which was the
			inspiration for much of this code. Visit http://cgfm2.emuviews.com for the
			download, also home of some _very_ good Sega Genesis VDP documentation.

			The ASM 68k Core causes a scoring problem in Columns, Starscream does this also,
			with the C 68k Core the scoring in columns is correct.

			Bloxeed doesn't Read from the Protection Chip at all; all of the other games do.
			Currently the protection chip is mostly understood, and needs a table of 256
			4-bit values for each game. In all cases except for Poto Poto and Puyo Puyo 2,
			the table is embedded in the code. Workarounds for the other 2 cases are
			provided.

			I'm assuming System-C was the Board without the uPD7759 chip and System-C2 was the
			version of the board with it, this could be completely wrong but it doesn't really
			matter anyway.

			Vertical 2 Cell Based Scrolling won't be 100% accurate on a line that uses a Line
			Scroll value which isn't divisible by 8.. I've never seen a C2 game do this tho.


	Bugs:	Puyo Puyo ends up with a black screen after doing memory tests
			Battery-backed RAM needs to be figured out


	Thanks:	(in no particular order) to any MameDev that helped me out .. (OG, Mish etc.)
			Charles MacDonald for his C2Emu .. without it working out what were bugs in my code
				and issues due to protection would have probably killed the driver long ago :p
			Razoola & Antiriad .. for helping teach me some 68k ASM needed to work out just why
				the games were crashing :)
			Sega for producing some Fantastic Games...
			and anyone else who knows they've contributed :)

	Interrupt handling
*******************************************************************************

	The C/C2 System uses 3 Different Interrupts, IRQ2, IRQ4 and IRQ6.

	IRQ6 = Vblank, this happens after the last visible line of the display has
			been drawn (after line 224)

	IRQ4 = H-Int, this happens based upon the value in H-Int Counter.  If the
			Horizontal Interrupt is enabled and the Counter Value = 0 there
			will be a Level 4 Interrupt Triggered

	IRQ2 = sound int, generated by the YM3438

	--------

	More H-Counter Information:

	Providing Horizontal Interrupts are active the H-Counter will be loaded
	with the value stored in register #10 (0x0A) at the following times:
		(1) At the top of the display, before drawing the first line
		(2) When the counter has expired
		(3) During the VBlank Period (lines 224-261)
	The Counter is decreased by 1 after every line.

 The I/O chip is mapped to $A10000-$A1001F in the 68000/VDP/Z80 banked address space.
 It is normally read and written in byte units at odd addresses. The chip gets /LWR only,
 so writing to even addresses has no effect. Reading even addresses returns the same data
 ou'd get from an odd address. If a word-sized write is done, the LSB is sent to the I/O chip
 and the MSB is ignored.

/******************************************************************************
	Input Ports
*******************************************************************************

	The input ports on the C2 games always consist of 1 Coin Port, 2 Player
	Input ports and 2 Dipswitch Ports, 1 of those Dipswitch Ports being used
	for coinage, the other for Game Options.

	Most of the Games List the Dipswitchs and Inputs in the Test Menus, adding
	them is just a tedious task.  I think Columnns & Bloxeed are Exceptions
	and will need their Dipswitches working out by observation.  The Coin Part
	of the DSW's seems fairly common to all games.

	was credited to SpainDumps in the included text file.  This appears to be
	a bad dump (half sized roms) however the roms do not match up exactly with
	the good dump of the game.  English language sets are assumed to be the
	parent where they exist.  Hopefully some more alternate version dumps will
	turn up sometime soon for example English Language version of Tant-R or
	Japanese Language versions of Borench (if of course these games were

	All of the Sega C/C2 games apart from Bloxeed used a protection chip.
	The games contain various checks which make sure this protection chip is
	present and returning the expected values.  The chip uses a table of
	256x4-bit values to produce its results.  It appears that different
	tables are used for Japanese vs. English variants of some games
