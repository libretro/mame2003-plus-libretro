Proof of concept
Based on MAME 0.78

Tested for OS X, linux, Wii, and Android (arm-v7a).

Generates directories as it requires:
* User-generated content: Saves (NVRAM, MEMCARD), Hi-Scores, and Controller Config files
  are in sub-directories within /Retroarch Savefile Dir/mame2003/.
* Everything else (Cheats, Mame INI, etc) in sub-directories within
  /Retroarch System Dir/mame2003/.

TODO:

* Make sure all of the mkdir commands in makefile complete before any compiling starts.
* Input Descriptors (for use in Core Input Remapping).
* Lots more.

Notes:

* Will have errors on 64-bit platforms.
* Will have errors on platforms without unaligned memory access support.
* When using concurrent building you may get an error that it can't create certain object files, just rerun make if it happens.
* To run on Wii's memory constraints some drivers in src/driver.c must be removed.
