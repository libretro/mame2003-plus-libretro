## What is MAME 2003-Plus?

MAME 2003-Plus (also referred to as MAME 2003+ and mame2003-plus) is a libretro arcade system emulator core with an emphasis on high performance and broad compatibility with mobile devices, single board computers, embedded systems, and similar platforms.

In order to take advantage of the performance and lower hardware requirements of an earlier MAME architecture, MAME 2003-Plus began with the MAME 2003 codebase which is itself derived from xmame 0.78. Upon that base, MAME 2003-Plus contributors have backported support for an additional 350 games, as well as other functionality not originally present in the underlying codebase.

## What Arcade romsets work with MAME 2003-Plus and how to build them

**mame2003-plus was originally built from the MAME 0.78 codebase, meaning that 95% or more of MAME 0.78 romsets will work as-is in mame2003-plus, where they immediately benefit from its bugfixes and other improvements.** In order to play the new games and games which received ROM updates in mame2003-plus, you will need to find or build the correct romsets.

**[Read more about rebuilding romsets in the libretro core documentation for mame2003-plus](https://docs.libretro.com/library/mame2003_plus/#Building-romsets-for-MAME-2003-Plus)**.

## Why is this port here

** So I can actually use it on my barcade and have some auto mapping to gamepads and panels as well as fully user flexibility of the way mame was originally set up as well without the libreto intrustions that dont need to be there imho. As its for personal use I cant see any real issues.
